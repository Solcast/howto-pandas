# HowTo Solcast - Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and PvLib

NOTE: You will need to register your user account to obtain an API key [https://solcast.com.au/api/register](https://solcast.com.au/api/register/).  Without an API key you will not be able to successfully obtain valid API results.

### Windows setup Solcast API Key

Setup System/User `environment variable`.  Details on advanced editing [StackOverflow superuser walkthrough](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10)

```
WinKey + R
```

Copy and Paste the following text to the **Open:** input text box for the Run Dialog

```
%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables
```

That will present this screen

![Run Windows Environment Editor](/imgs/win_launch_environment_editor.png)

Add a user or system `environment variable` to hold the Solcast API key.  User environment variables will only be available to your particular user, system environment variables are shared for all users on the system

![Add Windows User Solcast API key](/imgs/win_env_user_variable.png)

After you have added the `environment variable` you will see the key listed in the current variables

![Added Windows User Solcast API key](/imgs/win_solcast_variable.png)

**NOTE**: To reference this key you will need to reopen your shell prompt to read these variables again from the system (cmd, command.com, powershell, etc)


### Linux / mac OS

Open a terminal prompt
- mac OS: Spotlight search for `terminal`
- Linux: Open `bash`

```
nano .bash_profile
```

If you do not have nano it is simpler text editor than `vi`.  Use your package manager to download and install or use `vi`.  The preferred package manager for mac OS is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and once installed on your system you can issue similar commands to Linux `apt-get` and `yum` with the `brew` package manager.

Add the Solcast API Key to your user profile variables.

### This how to demonstrates working with using the Solcast API to load pandas data frames and then plot different chart data.  Tested and built with Python 3.6.2

This is a demonstration project that shows an example of how to use the [solcast-py](https://github.com/Solcast/solcast-py) library to load a [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) data frame and then display a single field graphically using [MatPlotLib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib).  A familiarity with Python is not required.

### Clone or download this project

### Install all the require dependencies

If you are not familiar with the python module pip, please refer to this [PIP for Python](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

```
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively you may need to use sudo the `-H` instructs `sudo` to install dependencies to local users home directory instead of system
```
sudo -H pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
If you are receiving an error when installing the netcdf4 package on Mac such as:
```
ValueError: did not find netCDF version 4 headers
```
or
```
ValueError: did not find hdf5 version 4 headers
```
These two packages need to be installed onto your Mac with homebrew.
Click this link to install homebrew [here](https://brew.sh).
These packages are located in the homebrew/science section. You will need to "tap" this section to access it. More information is found [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science).

NOTE: Installing hdf5 on mac will take **a long time**. Give it time.
### Latitude and Longitude

- First as stated above you will need an API key to make valid API requests to the Solcast system.
- Second for all current library calls you will need a valid Lat/Lng coordinate in the [EPSG:4326](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/) format.  If you are familiar with modern web maps you most likely have used the expected format or a decimal point that expresses a position on the Earth.

Clarification as I often forget the coordinate planes of Latitude and Longitude along with bounds.
![Lat/Lng](/imgs/Lat_Long.gif)

[Credits - Learner.org](http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/LongitudeIntro.html)

The Solcast API expects **East** for Longitude and **South** for Latitude to be expressed as a negative numbers

Example Locations on the Globe

Name | Latitude | Longitude
--- | --- | ---
Sydney, Australia | -33.865143 | 151.209900
Mumbai, India |â€Ž 19.228825 | 72.854118
Tokyo, Japan | 35.6895 | 139.69171
Paris, France | 48.864716 | 2.349014
Los Angeles, USA | 34.052235 | -118.243683

### Power/Radiation library method interaction

In the file **main.py** is a minimal set of commands to obtain the following charts.  The break in the continuity between the **Estimated Actuals** and the **Forecast** predicted values on the time scale is due to that the time period falls between an in place Estimated Actual result being recorded and a next period available Forecast.  Currently all period results are broken into **30** minute timestamp periods.  This howto uses the `period_end` fields as the indexed field for the DataFrames (x - axis on the following charts)

Within this project workspace is folder `solcast_frames` that provides some `solcast-py` library helper translators to `pandas` DataFrames.  In the `main.py` file these helper classes are referenced below.

```python
# This line is only for using the matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from solcast_frames.latlng import LatLng
from solcast_frames.radiationframehandler import RadiationFrameHandler
from solcast_frames.powerframehandler import PowerFrameHandler

plt.interactive(False) # Turn this off to create plots
```

These following python classes are now available to use `LatLng`, `RadiationFrameHandler`, `PowerFrameHandler`

First you should create a location to obtain results for solcast forecasts.  Example below.

```python
location = LatLng(lat=-33.86785, lng=151.215256, name="Sydney", tag="No wild Koalas", timezone="Australia/Sydney")
```

The `LatLng` helper class if no keyword arguments are supplied will set your location to (0,0) on the globe

The `LatLng` class contains a `desc()` method to give you a string output of its current details if needed i.e. `print(location.desc())`

To obtain and plot the current estimates and forecast from the Solcast API for **PvPower** use the following code
```python

# Plot the power `pv_estimate`
# Required fields latlng valid position, capacity as integer > 0
# Adding in an optional keyword argument of an azimuth of 0
# The following optional keyword arguments are recognized by the solcast-py library
# azimuth | range: [-180 to 180] default: 0 in Southern Hemisphere, 180 in Northern Hemisphere
# tilt | range: [0 to 90] | default: 23
# install_date | format: yyyyMMdd Will be ignored if a loss_factor is supplied
# latest | [True, False] | default False
power_estimated_actuals = PowerFrameHandler.estimated_actuals(location, 5000, azimuth=0)
power_estimated_actuals.pv_estimate.plot()

# Plot the power `pv_estimate`
# Required fields latlng valid position, capacity as integer > 0
# The following optional keyword arguments are recognized by the solcast-py library
# azimuth | range: [-180 to 180] default: 0 in Southern Hemisphere, 180 in Northern Hemisphere
# tilt | range: [0 to 90] | default: 23
# install_date | format: yyyyMMdd Will be ignored if a loss_factor is supplied
# loss_factor | [0 to 1] | default 0.9
fx_solcast_power = PowerFrameHandler.forecast(location, 5000)
fx_solcast_power.pv_estimate.plot()
plt.show()
```

**Power** `Estimated Actuals` with `Forecast` (`pv_estimate` over `period_end`)
![Power Graph](/imgs/power.png)

To obtain and plot the current estimates and forecast from the Solcast API for **Radiation** use the following code

```python
# Plot the radiation `ghi` field
# Required fields latlng valid position
# The following optional keyword arguments are recognized by the solcast-py library
# latest | [True, False] | default False
radiation_estimated_actuals = RadiationFrameHandler.estimated_actuals(location)
radiation_estimated_actuals.ghi.plot()
# Plot the radiation `ghi` field
# Required fields latlng valid position
fx_solcast_radiation = RadiationFrameHandler.forecast(location)
fx_solcast_radiation.ghi.plot()
plt.show()
```

### Details of Solcast Python Client Library [Solcast Python API client library ](https://github.com/Solcast/solcast-py)

The Solcast Python library is designed as a synchronous web service and does not include the graphing or advanced data options of Pandas/MatPlotLib.

The `PowerFrameHandler.py` and `RadiationFrameHandler.py` classes in this howto under `solcast_frames` example convert the list value resultsets into `pandas` dataframes aligned and indexed by the `period_end` DateTime field (all datetimes are expressed in UTC timezone).

### Integrating with [pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

In the file **main.py** is a minimal set of commands to obtain the following charts.  The pvlib library is a powerful open source tool that is used in computing and forecasting photovoltaic solar cell arrays.  There are numerous options and details that can be configured, the following example compares pvlib forecasts with Solcast forecasts and how to obtain datasets that can be compared and graphed.

```python
# This line is only for using the matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from solcast_frames.latlng import LatLng
from solcast_frames.radiationframehandler import RadiationFrameHandler
import timeit
import pandas as pd
import datetime
# import pvlib forecast models
from pvlib.forecast import GFS, NAM, NDFD, HRRR, RAP

plt.interactive(False) # Turn this off to create plots

#
# Following code is from http://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/forecasts.html
#

# Changing the location pvlib default model uses Tucson for examples
location = LatLng(lat=32.2, lng=-110.9, name="Tucson", tag="Cactus Land", timezone="US/Arizona")
print(location.desc())

start_time = timeit.default_timer()
radiationForecast = RadiationFrameHandler.forecast(location)
elapsed = timeit.default_timer() - start_time
print("Solcast Radiation Forecast Location: %s Time: %s (seconds)" % (location.name, '%.6f' % elapsed))

# specify time range with timezone
start = pd.Timestamp(datetime.date.today(), tz=location.timezone)
end = start + pd.Timedelta(days=7)

start_time = timeit.default_timer()
# fx is a common abbreviation for forecast
fx_model = GFS() # From Forecast models http://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#forecast-models
fx_data = fx_model.get_processed_data(location.lat, location.lng, start, end)
elapsed = timeit.default_timer() - start_time
print("pvlib (GFS) Radiation Forecast Location: %s Time: %s (seconds)" % (location.name, '%.6f' % elapsed))


plt.plot(fx_data.ghi, label="ghi - PVLIB (GFS)")
plt.plot(radiationForecast.ghi, label="ghi - Solcast", linestyle='dashdot')

plt.plot(fx_data.dhi, label="dhi - PVLIB (GFS)")
plt.plot(radiationForecast.dhi, label="dhi - Solcast", linestyle='dashdot')

plt.plot(fx_data.dni, label="dni - PVLIB (GFS)")
plt.plot(radiationForecast.dni, label="dni - Solcast", linestyle='dashdot')

plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
